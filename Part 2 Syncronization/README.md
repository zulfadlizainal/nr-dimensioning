# Part 2 - Synchronization
Simulations on the topics of PSS, SSS, PBCH, and SSB occupancy in 5G resource grid.

#### 1. PSS, SSS Occupancy ([Link](https://github.com/zulfadlizainal/5G-NR-Planning-And-Dimensioning/tree/master/Part%202%20Syncronization/1_PSS%20SSS%20Occupancy))

The resource utilized by PSS and SSS depending on L (Count of SSB in 1 SSB Burst Set) and p (SSB Periodicity).
<br />

#### 2. PBCH Occupancy ([Link](https://github.com/zulfadlizainal/5G-NR-Planning-And-Dimensioning/tree/master/Part%202%20Syncronization/2_PBCH%20Occupancy))

The resource utilized by PBCH depending on L (Count of SSB in 1 SSB Burst Set) and p (SSB Periodicity).
<br />

#### 3. SSB Occupancy ([Link](https://github.com/zulfadlizainal/5G-NR-Planning-And-Dimensioning/tree/master/Part%202%20Syncronization/3_SSB%20Occupancy))

The resource utilized by SSB depending on L (Count of SSB in 1 SSB Burst Set) and p (SSB Periodicity).
